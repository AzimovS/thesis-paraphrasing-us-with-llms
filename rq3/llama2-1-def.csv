These methods allow you to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where the similarity between vectors corresponds to the similarity in meaning between words. By reducing the dimensionality of these vectors using techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), you can reduce the average length of words in the text while preserving the most important information.

For example, suppose you have a dataset of scientific papers with an average length of 1000 words per paper. Using PCA, you could reduce the dimensionality of the word vectors to a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 50 dimensions) while preserving the most important information in the text. This would result in an average length of 200 words per paper, which is significantly shorter than the original length.

Alternatively, you could use a language modeling algorithm to predict the next word in a sequence of text given the previous words. By training the language model on a large dataset of scientific papers, you could learn a mapping from the input text to a lower-dimensional representation that captures the most important information in the text. This would allow you to reduce the average length of words in the text while preserving the meaning and context of the text.
